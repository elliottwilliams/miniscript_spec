# 1.1 Tokens

## 1.1.1 Identifiers
Identifiers begin with a letter, which can be followed by additional
letters, numbers, or underscores.

### 1.1.1.1 Letters
Letters range from `a` to `z` and from `A` to `Z`.

### 1.1.1.2 Numbers
Numbers are characters `0` through `9` in the ASCII alphabet.


## 1.1.2 White spaces
### 1.1.2.1 Separators
Spaces `' '` and tabs `'\t'` are separators, and are equivalent tokens.

### 1.1.2.2 Newlines
UNIX newlines `'\n'` are recognized as newlines. A line is a sequence of
any symbols followed by a newline.


## 1.1.3 Constant literals
### 1.1.3.1 String literals

String literals are delimited by double-quotes (`"`), and contain zero or more
characters. A [newline][1.1.2.2] may *not* appear inside a string literal. Since
`"` delimits the string, a `"` cannot be included within the literal.

**TODO:** Determine if string literals accept escape sequences, e.g. `\"` and
`\\`.

### 1.1.3.2 Unsigned integer literals
Unsigned integer literals are made up of one or more numbers. Leading zeroes
have no effect on the interpretation of an integer's value, i.e. `00123 ==
123`.

## 1.1.4 Arithmetic operators

Add `+`, subtract `-`, multiply `*`, and divide `/` are all valid
arithmetic operators.

## 1.1.5 Parentheses

The open-paren `(` and close-paren `)` are recognized parentheses.
