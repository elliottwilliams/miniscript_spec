# 1.2 Tokens

## 1.2.1 Identifiers

Identifiers begin with a [letter][1.1.1], which can be followed by additional
letters, numbers, or underscores.

## 1.2.2 Constant literals

### 1.2.2.1 String literals

String literals are delimited by double-quotes (`"`), and contain zero or more
characters. A [newline][1.1.3.2] may not appear inside a string literal. Since
`"` delimits the string, a `"` cannot be included within the literal.

**TODO:** Determine if string literals accept escape sequences, e.g. `\"` and
`\\`.

### 1.2.2.2 Unsigned integer literals

Unsigned integer literals are made up of one or more numbers. Leading zeroes
have no effect on the interpretation of an integer's value, i.e. `00123 ==
123`.

## 1.2.3 Delimitation

All token types except for string literals may be delimited by one or more
[separators][1.1.3.1].


[1.1.1]: 1.1-symbols.md#111-letters
[1.1.3.1]: 1.1-symbols.md#1131-separators
[1.1.3.2]: 1.1-symbols.md#1132-newlines
