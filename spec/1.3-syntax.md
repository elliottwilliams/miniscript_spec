# 1.3 Structure

## 1.3.1 White space
[Separators][1.2.2.1] are used to separate tokens.


## 1.3.2 Opening and closing tags
A valid miniscript program has HTML-style tags at its beginning and end. The
tags are on separate lines, and have zero or more lines between them.

### 1.3.2.1 Opening tags
`<script type="text/JavaScript">` is the opening tag.
The opening tag must be the first line of the script. 

### 1.3.2.2 Closing tags
`</script>` is the closing tag.
Zero or more newlines are allowed to follow the closing tag.

### 1.3.2.3 Other lines
Each line in between the opening and closing tags contain zero or more
[statements][1.4].


## 1.3.3 Delimiters
Statements are terminated by either:

- one semicolon (`;`)
- one or more [newlines][1.2.2.2], optionally preceded by [separators][1.2.2.1]

Since newlines separate statements from each other, the entirety of a statement
must be on a single line.

A semicolon terminating a statement must occur on the same line as that
statement.
