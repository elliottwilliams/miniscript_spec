# 1.4 Statements

A statement represents a singular action in miniscript. Example statements
include:

    var result = two + ten;
    document.write(result)
    result = ten * ten

## 1.4.1 Delimitation

Statements are terminated by either:

- one semicolon (`;`)
- one or more [newlines][1.1.3.2], optionally preceded by [separators][1.1.3.1]

**TODO:** Determine if separators can precede a semicolon in a valid statement.

Since newlines separate statements from each other, the entirety of a statement
must be on a single line.

A semicolon terminating a statement must occur on the same line as that
statement.
