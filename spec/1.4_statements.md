# 1.4 Statements

A statement represents a singular action in miniscript. Example statements
include:

    var result = two + ten;
    document.write(result)
    result = ten * ten


## 1.4.1 Document write statements
These statements follow the exact form of `document.write(<param_list>)`, where
`<param_list>` is a [parameter list][1.6]. No white space can appear around the
enclosing parentheses.

document.write prints the string value of each parameter passed to it. Numeric
parameters are printed by their `%d` format string specification.

### 1.4.1.1 Line break tag
document.write handles one string uniquely: the line break tag, `"<br/>"`.
When it is passed to `document.write`, the interpreter prints a newline (`\n`),
rather than the characters of the tag itself. It is assumed that `"<br/>"`
never appears inside another string.


## 1.4.2 Assignment statements
Assignments are of the form `<variable> = <expression>`.

An assignment replaces the value of the left-hand side with the value of the
right-hand side. The following type pairs are acceptable:

| lhs         | rhs           |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| undefined   | any type      |
| string      | string        |
| number      | number        |

Note that assignment requires the left-hand side to be declared.

The left-hand side variable is either an [identifier][1.1.1], or a [field
accessor][2.1.3].


## 1.4.3 Declarations
Declarations can take two different forms:

- assigning: `var <assignment>` (-> `var <identifier> = <expression>`)
- non-assigning: `var <declarations>`

Declarations reset the determined type for the variable being declared. the
right-hand side of a declaration is determined by whether a [variable][1.7] or
an [object][2.1] is begin declared:

### 1.4.3.1 Variable declarations
Non-assigning variable declarations have no right-hand side. Their initial type
is [undefined][2.3].

    `var <identifier>`

Assigning variable declarations have an expression on their right-hand side:

    `var <identifier> = <expression>`

### 1.4.3.2 Object declarations
There is no distinction between assigning and non-assigning object
declarations---all object declarations assign the created object scope to the
variable identifier on the left-hand side.

Object declarations follow [object syntax][2.1.1].


## 1.4.4 Compound statements (blocks)
Statements enclosed in curly braces are evaluated in a new [variable scope].
The opening curly brace `{` is followed by a newline. The closing brace `}`
appears at the start of a line, although a trailing semicolon (ending the
statement) is accepted.

Test cases assume a non-empty list of statements within the block.
