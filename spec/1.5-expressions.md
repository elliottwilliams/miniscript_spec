# 1.5 Expressions
Miniscript includes elementary arithmetic expressions. An expression consists
of either an [identifier][1.1.1], a [`uint` literal][1.1.3.2], or an [arithmetic
operation][1.1.4].

Expressions may be surrounded by parentheses to guarantee their
evaluation independent from surrounding expressions.

## 1.5.1 Arithmetic expressions
A standard arithmetic operation consists of two expressions joined by an [arithmetic
operator][1.1.4]:

    <expression> <operator> <expression>

Additionally, expressions can be nested...

    |----------------------------------------------------------|
    |----------------------------------|
    <expression> <operator> <expression> <operator> <expression>

...they can be contained by parentheses...

    (<expression>)
    (<expression> <operator> <expression>)
    (<expression>) <operator> <expression>
    <expression> <operator> (<expression> <operator> (<expression>))

...and they can resolve to a nonterminal identifier or unsigned integer:

    <identifier>
    <number>
