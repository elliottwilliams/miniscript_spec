# 1.5 Expressions
Miniscript includes elementary arithmetic expressions. An expression consists
of either a [constant][1.1.3], or an [arithmetic operation][1.1.4].

Expressions may be surrounded by parentheses to guarantee their
evaluation independent from surrounding expressions.

## 1.5.1 Arithmetic operations
A standard arithmetic operation consists of two expressions joined by an [arithmetic
operator][1.1.4]:

    <expression> <operator> <expression>

## 1.5.2 Grouping

Expressions can be grouped compound with left-associativity...

    |----------------------------------------------------------|
    |----------------------------------|
    <expression> <operator> <expression> <operator> <expression>

...and can be grouped by parentheses:

    (<expression>)
    (<expression> <operator> <expression>)
    (<expression>) <operator> <expression>
    <expression> <operator> (<expression> <operator> (<expression>))

## 1.5.3 Value resolution

The above expressions are recursively defined. At their base, an expression
resolves to either a scalar variable or an object field:

    <identifier>
    <number>
    <string>
    <identifier>.<identifier>

Notably, [object variables][2.3.3] and [undefined variables][2.3.4] are *not*
valid expressions.
