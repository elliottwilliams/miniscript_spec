# 2.1 Objects

An object is a mapping of [IDs] to [expressions]. Their syntax roughly follows
JSON syntax, with exceptions.


## 2.1.1 Object declaration
All fields of an object must be declared before they can be accessed:

    var obj = {
        <field_list>
    }

Upon declaration, the types of all fields in an object are undefined. Upon
their first assignment, their type is determined.

### 2.1.1.1 Braces

[Curly braces][1.1.6] enclose object fields. The opening brace must be followed
by a newline. The closing brace must appear on its own line.

**TODO:** Determine if there are any special rules about a semicolon or newline
following the closing brace. If not, the closing brace can be treated as the
end of the object declaration statement.

### 2.1.1.2 Field lists

A field list is of the form:
    
    <field_decl>, <field_decl>, <field_decl>

Fields lists are made up of at least one [field declaration][2.1.2]. Field
declarations are separated by commas.


## 2.1.2 Field declaration
Field declarations take one of two forms:

- assigning: `<identifier>: <expression>`
- non-assigning: `<identifier>`

Declarations must be on a single line.

Nested objects are forbidden. The type of a field of an object must be a [scalar
variable][1.7].

Field types are determined based on the first value assigned.


## 2.1.3 Field accessors
Fields of an object are accessed by dot syntax:

    <object_id>.<field_id>

A field accessor is treated as a [variable], and valid in all contexts where a
variable ID is valid. Thus, fields can be assigned to by:

    <object_id>.<field_id> = <value>
