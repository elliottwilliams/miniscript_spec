# 2.2 Operators

Miniscript includes standard arithmetic operators, which are recognized by the
[tokenizer][1.1.4]. They are overloaded as follows.

## 2.2.1 Numeric operator

`+`, `-`, `*`, `/` on [numbers] produce numeric results as expected.

## 2.2.2 String operator

`+` concatenates strings.

## 2.2.3 Assignment operator

Assignments replaces the value of the left-hand side [variable][1.7] with the
value of the right-hand side. The following type pairs are acceptable:

| lhs         | rhs           |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| undefined   | any type      |
| string      | string        |
| number      | number        |

Note that assignment requires the left-hand side to be declared.
