# 2.3 Types

Miniscript is dynamically typed. [Variables][1.7] have their type fixed upon first
assignment.

## 2.3.1 Number

All numbers in Miniscript are integers, in accordance with the [number literals
recognized by the tokenizer][1.1.3.2].

## 2.3.2 String

Strings are sequences of `char`s. Miniscript follows a bag-of-bytes approach,
and no encoding is enforced.

## 2.3.3 Object

[Objects][1.7] are scopes associated with a variable name. Some unique enforcement is
done on objects:

- Declared object variables cannot be assigned to. Once an object is declared,
  only its [declared fields][2.1.2] can be accessed and assigned to. The
  [assignment operator] enforces this.
- Objects cannot be assigned to fields of another object, i.e. objects cannot
  be nested. The type checker refuses to assign an object to an object field.

## 2.3.4 Undefined

`undefined` is the type associated with a variable that has not been
assigned to. Assignments can be made to undefined variables, but other operators do
not accept this type.

## 2.3.5 Undeclared

`undeclared` is a metatype reported for any variable that cannot be found in
the scope chain. The only statement that accepts undeclared variables is the
[declaration statement].
